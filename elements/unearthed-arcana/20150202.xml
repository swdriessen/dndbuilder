    <name>Unearthed Arcana: Eberron</name>
    <description>The Eberron campaign setting was created by Keith Baker and first published for D&amp;D in 2004. It combines pulp adventure and intrigue in a world where magic-driven technology has produced airships, trains, and similar advancements comparable to early 20th-century Europe. The continent of Khorvaire, the center of Eberronâ€™s focus, has recently emerged from the Last War, a terrible conflict that saw the kingdom of Cyre transformed into a lifeless gray wasteland called the Mournland. That catastrophe shocked the remaining kingdoms into an uneasy peace that has held so far.</description>
