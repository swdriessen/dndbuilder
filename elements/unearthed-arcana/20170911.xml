        <description>
            <p>As creatures of the Feywild, eladrin can be wildly unpredictable. They tend toward an alignment of chaotic neutral, mixing a love of freedom with benign self-interest. Eladrin that embrace good or evil take their beliefs to an extreme, serving as great champions of justice or terrifying villains.</p>

            <h4>THE FOUR SEASONS</h4>
            <p>Each eladrin has four distinct personality states—one for each season—that they shift between when they experience powerful emotion.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Autumn</b> is the season of peace and goodwill, when summer’s harvest is shared with all. Eladrin adopt this personality when overcome with contentment.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Winter</b> is the season of dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers. It is a time of sadness and regret, entered when eladrin are overcome with sorrow.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Spring</b> is the season of cheerfulness and unfettered celebration, marked by merriment as winter’s sorrow passes. Eladrin enter this state when overcome with joy.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Summer</b> is the season of boldness and aggression, a time of unfettered energy. Eladrin enter this state when overcome with fury.</p>
            <p class="indent">You may create personality traits and flaws for each of your seasons, reflecting an eladrin’s tempestuous personality. You can roll on the following tables or read them for inspiration. To add some chaos to your character, you may roll on these tables each time you change seasons.</p>


            <h4>ELADRIN TRAITS</h4>
            <p>The chaotic eladrin are creatures of powerful emotions, infused with a power that can align with the magic of the seasons.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Increase. </i></b>Your Intelligence or Charisma score increases by 1 (your choice).</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Fey Step. </i></b>As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Once you use this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Shifting Seasons. </i></b>At the end of each short or long rest, you can align yourself with the magic of one season, regardless of the season that is dominating your personality. Doing so allows you to cast a certain cantrip, as shown in the Shifting Seasons Cantrips table. When you align yourself with a season’s magic, you lose the cantrip associated with the previous season and gain the cantrip associated with the new season.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your spellcasting ability for these cantrips is Intelligence or Charisma, whichever is higher.</p>

            <!-- short racial description from the monster manual -->
            <p>The warlike githyanki and the contemplative githzerai are a sundered people- two cultures that utterly despise one another. Before there were githyanki or githzerai, these creatures were a single race enslaved by the mind flayers. Although they attempted to overthrow their masters many times, their rebellions were repeatedly crushed until a great leader named Gith arose.</p>
            <p class="indent">After much bloodshed, Gith and her followers threw off the yoke of their illithid masters, but another leader named Zerthimon emerged in the aftermath of battle. Zerthimon challenged Gith's motives, claiming that her strict martial leadership and desire for vengeance amounted to little more than another form of slavery for her people. A rift erupted between followers of each leader, and they eventually became the two races whose enmity endures to this day.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whether these tall, gaunt creatures were peaceful or savage, cultured or primitive before the mind flayers enslaved and changed them, none can say. Not even the original name of their race remains from that distant time.</p>

            <p>Gith feature a number of common traits.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Increase. </i></b>Your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Age. </i></b>Gith reach adulthood in their late teens and live for about a century.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Size. </i></b>Gith are taller and leaner than humans, with most a slender 6 feet in height.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Speed. </i></b>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Languages. </i></b>You can speak, read, and write Common and Gith.</p>
