      <p>You have mastered techniques to take advantage of every drop in any enemy’s guard, gaining the following benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the creature’s speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.</li>
        <li>Creatures within 5 feet of you provoke opportunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action before leaving your reach.</li>
        <li>When a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack against a target other than you (and that target doesn’t have this feat), you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacking creature.</li>
      </ul>
