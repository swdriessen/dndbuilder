    <description>
      <p class="flavor">Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves. Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their emotional and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely touches them. Others live with the elves, growing restless as they reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while their peers continue to live as children. Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.</p>
      <!--<h4>HALF-ELF NAMES</h4>
      <p>Half-elves use either human or elven naming conventions. As if to emphasize that they don’t really fit in to either society, half-elves raised among humans are often given elven names, and those raised among elves often take human names.</p>-->
      <h4>HALF-ELF TRAITS</h4>
      <p>Your half-elf character has some qualities in common with elves and some that are unique to half-elves.</p>
      <p>
        <span class="feature">Ability Score Increase.</span>Your Charisma score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.<br/>
        <span class="feature">Age.</span>Half-elves mature at the same rate humans do and reach adulthood around the age of 20. They live much longer than humans, however, often exceeding 180 years.<br/>
        <span class="feature">Alignment.</span>Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their elven heritage. They value both personal freedom and creative expression, demonstrating neither love of leaders nor desire for followers. They chafe at rules, resent others’ demands, and sometimes prove unreliable, or at least unpredictable.<br/>
        <span class="feature">Size.</span>Half-elves are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.<br/>
        <span class="feature">Speed.</span>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br/>
        <span class="feature">Darkvision.</span>Thanks to your elf blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br/>
        <span class="feature">Fey Ancestry.</span>You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.<br/>
        <span class="feature">Skill Versatility.</span>You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.<br/>
        <span class="feature">Languages.</span>You can speak, read, and write Common, Elvish, and one extra language of your choice.<br/>
